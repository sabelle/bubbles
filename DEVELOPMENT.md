## Bubble Notes


##### 4/7/19
- [x] implement ofxTransparentWindow to of window transparent
- [x] have some circles ("bubbles")

:sparkles: :sparkles: :sparkles: 
created some circles on a transparent fullscreen background

##### 4/14/19
- [ ] ability to resize bubbles
- [x] simple movement 
- [ ] 3D (shading) bubbles - more realistic(?) than 2D 

:sparkles: :sparkles: :sparkles: 
added movement to bubbles using ofxBox2d, however bubble cannot be dragged around unless background is _not_ transparent. i set the gravity to 0 so that bubble can float freely, however the user must drag the first bubble (and subsequent bubbles if no collision occurs) to initiate movement. this obviously doesnt allow for a transparent screen, so the ofxTransparentWindow might need to go. 

the bubbles always have a black line from the center to edge. tried overriding ofxBox2dCircle.draw() method to remove the line but it didn't work, so  i want to try making a custom polygon (circle). also i want to add a feature of double clicking the bubble and then it'll be deleted.

##### 4/21/19
- [ ] remove black radial(?) line on bubbles
- [x] make bubbles a variety of (consistent) colors and not an epilepsy-inducing disco fiasco > multiple methods?
- [ ] i was going to add something else but i forgot // placeholder


- [ ] movement - have different settings of movement, random, simple, etc
    * from code review have option to have bubbles all fall to bottom of screen?
- [ ] add text >> find a way to save text inputs - .txt files?

each call to add a bubble adds 2 different colored bubbles at once -> had an issue where every 3 bubble calls would display color and inbetween it didn't work so this is the solutionbbb

##### 4/28/19
- [ ] add background sound
- [ ] add option to change bubble color?
- [ ] some additional features?
